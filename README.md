## 🎯 Overview

This **Polymarket arbitrage bot** runs a **dump-and-hedge** strategy on Polymarket’s 15m Up/Down markets (e.g. BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP) by:

- **Market discovery** – Finds the current 15m market per asset via Gamma API slug
- **Price monitoring** – Polls CLOB orderbooks for Up/Down bid/ask and time remaining
- **Dump detection** – In the first N minutes of each period, detects a sharp price drop on one side (Up or Down)
- **Leg 1** – Buys the dumped side at the dip
- **Hedge (Leg 2)** – Waits until combined cost (leg1 + opposite ask) is at or below target (e.g. ≤ 0.95), then buys the opposite side to lock in profit
- **Stop-loss hedge** – If the hedge condition isn’t met within a max wait time, hedges anyway to limit risk
- **Settlement** – On market close, redeems winning outcome tokens and tracks P&L
- **Simulation mode** – Run without placing real orders (default); switch to production when ready
- **Type-safe** – Full TypeScript with strict types and clear config via `.env`

Perfect for automating the dump-and-hedge arbitrage on Polymarket 15m markets with controllable risk and optional dry-run.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Trading & Strategy
- **Dump-and-hedge** – Buy the dip on one outcome, then hedge when sum of prices ≤ target
- **Multi-asset** – Supports BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP 15m markets (configurable via `MARKETS`)
- **Automatic market discovery** – Resolves current 15m market by slug and period timestamp
- **Period rollover** – Detects new 15m periods and switches to the new market automatically
- **Stop-loss hedge** – Time-based fallback hedge if ideal hedge price isn’t reached

### 🛡️ Risk & Safety
- **Simulation by default** – No real orders until you set `PRODUCTION=true` or use `npm run prod`
- **Configurable sizing** – Shares per leg, sum target, move threshold, and watch window
- **Stop-loss parameters** – Max wait before forced hedge and stop-loss percentage
- **Position tracking** – Per-period and total P&L; redemption of winning tokens on close

### 🔧 Production-Ready
- **Env-based config** – All settings in `.env` (no config files to commit)
- **CLOB auth** – API key derivation from signer or optional explicit API key/secret/passphrase
- **Proxy wallet support** – Optional Polymarket proxy/profile address and signature type (EOA / Proxy / GnosisSafe)
- **History logging** – Append-only `history.toml` for audit and debugging
- **Graceful handling** – Continues monitoring on transient API errors; clear stderr logging

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 16+** – [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Polygon wallet** – With USDC for trading (production)
- **POL/MATIC** – For gas when redeeming winning tokens (production)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/infraform/polymarket-arbitrage-bot.git
cd polymarket-arbitrage-bot

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Configuration

1. **Create environment file:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Edit `.env` with your settings:**
```env
# Required for production (real trades and redemption)
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...                    # Your wallet private key (hex, with or without 0x)
PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...           # Polymarket proxy/profile address (if using proxy)
SIGNATURE_TYPE=2                      # 0=EOA, 1=Proxy, 2=GnosisSafe

# Markets: comma-separated (btc, eth, sol, xrp)
MARKETS=btc

# Strategy (defaults are fine to start)
DUMP_HEDGE_SHARES=10
DUMP_HEDGE_SUM_TARGET=0.95
DUMP_HEDGE_MOVE_THRESHOLD=0.15
DUMP_HEDGE_WINDOW_MINUTES=2
DUMP_HEDGE_STOP_LOSS_MAX_WAIT_MINUTES=5
DUMP_HEDGE_STOP_LOSS_PERCENTAGE=0.2

# Simulation (default) vs production
PRODUCTION=false
```

3. **Run the bot:**
```bash
# Simulation (default) – no real orders
npm start
# or explicitly
npm run sim

# Production – real trades (ensure PRIVATE_KEY and optional PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS are set)
npm run prod

# Development – run TypeScript with ts-node
npm run dev
```

Logs go to stderr and are appended to `history.toml`.

| **Polling** | | |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | Orderbook poll interval (ms) | `1000` |
| `MARKET_CLOSURE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often to check market closure | `20` |
| **Markets & strategy** | | |
| `MARKETS` | Comma-separated: `btc`, `eth`, `sol`, `xrp` | `btc` |
| `DUMP_HEDGE_SHARES` | Shares per leg | `10` |

### Optional API overrides

If you don’t set `API_KEY` / `API_SECRET` / `API_PASSPHRASE`, the bot derives CLOB credentials from the signer (recommended). You can set them explicitly if you already have API keys.

## 📖 How It Works

### Dump-and-hedge flow

1. **Discovery** – For each asset in `MARKETS`, the bot finds the current 15m Up/Down market via Gamma API (slug pattern e.g. `btc-updown-15m-<timestamp>`).
2. **Monitoring** – Every `CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`, it fetches Up/Down orderbooks, computes best bid/ask, and builds a snapshot (prices + time remaining in the period).
3. **Watch window** – For the first `DUMP_HEDGE_WINDOW_MINUTES` of each 15m period, it watches for a **dump**: one side’s ask drops by at least `DUMP_HEDGE_MOVE_THRESHOLD` (e.g. 15%) within a short time window.
4. **Leg 1** – When a dump is detected, it buys `DUMP_HEDGE_SHARES` of that side (Up or Down) at the current ask.
5. **Hedge condition** – It then waits until `leg1_entry_price + opposite_ask ≤ DUMP_HEDGE_SUM_TARGET` (e.g. ≤ 0.95).
6. **Leg 2** – When the condition is met, it buys the same number of shares of the opposite outcome (hedge). Combined cost per “share pair” is ≤ target, so resolution pays $1 per share and locks in profit.
7. **Stop-loss** – If the hedge condition isn’t met within `DUMP_HEDGE_STOP_LOSS_MAX_WAIT_MINUTES`, it executes the hedge anyway at the current price (stop-loss hedge).
8. **New period** – When the 15m period rolls over, the bot discovers the new market and resets strategy state for the new period.
9. **Closure** – After market end, it checks resolution, redeems winning outcome tokens (production only), and updates P&L. Closure checks run every `MARKET_CLOSURE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.

### Simulation vs production

- **Simulation** (`PRODUCTION=false` or `npm run sim`): no orders sent to the CLOB; strategy logic and logging run as normal. Use this to verify behavior and parameters.
- **Production** (`PRODUCTION=true` or `npm run prod`): real orders and redemptions. Requires `PRIVATE_KEY`; set `PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS` and `SIGNATURE_TYPE` if you use a proxy/GnosisSafe.

## 📦 Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Run compiled bot (simulation by default) |
| `npm run sim` | Run in simulation mode explicitly |
| `npm run prod` | Run in production (real trades) |
| `npm run dev` | Run with ts-node (development) |

## 🐳 Docker (optional)

If you add a `Dockerfile` later:

```bash
docker build -t polymarket-arbitrage-bot .
docker run --env-file .env -d --name polymarket-arbitrage-bot polymarket-arbitrage-bot
docker logs -f polymarket-arbitrage-bot
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn’t find markets
- Confirm `MARKETS` is one of `btc`, `eth`, `sol`, `xrp` (comma-separated).
- Check network access to Gamma and CLOB APIs; try default `GAMMA_API_URL` and `CLOB_API_URL` first.

### Orders fail in production
- Ensure `PRIVATE_KEY` is set and correct (hex, with or without `0x`).
- If using a proxy, set `PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS` and `SIGNATURE_TYPE` (usually `2` for GnosisSafe).
- Verify USDC balance and that the market is still active and accepting orders.

### Redemption fails
- Ensure you have enough POL for gas on Polygon.
- Confirm the market is closed and resolved; the bot only redeems after resolution.

### No dumps detected
- Increase `DUMP_HEDGE_MOVE_THRESHOLD` (e.g. 0.10 → 0.15) or extend `DUMP_HEDGE_WINDOW_MINUTES`.
- Markets may be quiet; the strategy only acts when a sufficient short-term drop occurs.

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

- **Never commit `.env`** – Keep it in `.gitignore` (already listed).
- **Use env vars for secrets** – Don’t hardcode `PRIVATE_KEY` or API credentials.
- **Test in simulation first** – Run with `PRODUCTION=false` or `npm run sim` before enabling real trades.
- **Limit wallet use** – Prefer a dedicated wallet with limited funds for the bot.
- **Rotate keys** – Replace credentials if they may have been exposed.
